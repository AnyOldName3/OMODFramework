# OMODFramework

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/erri120/OMODFramework/_apis/build/status/erri120.OMODFramework?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/erri120/OMODFramework/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=master)

This project is the continuation and overhaul of my previous `OMOD-Framework`. Aside from the fact that I remove the `-` from the name, this project will be more refined than the last one. I've implemented more features from the [Oblivion Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2097) and finally use continuous integration with Azure DevOps to build, test and release this project.
